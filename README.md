DeepQMC implements variational quantum Monte Carlo for electrons in molecules, using deep neural networks written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) as trial wave functions. Besides the core functionality, it contains implementations of the following ansatzes:

- PauliNet [[video](https://youtu.be/_bdvpmleAgw)]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08423

- PauliNet with the Vandermonde determinant

## Installing

Install and update using [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/).

```
pip install -U deepqmc[wf,train]
```

## A simple example

```python
>>> from deepqmc import Molecule, evaluate, train
>>> from deepqmc.wf import PauliNet
>>> mol = Molecule.from_name('LiH')
>>> net = PauliNet.from_hf(mol).cuda()
converged SCF energy = -7.9846409186467
>>> train(net)
equilibrating: 64it [00:08,  7.58it/s]
training:   0%|  | 46/10000 [01:37<5:50:59,  2.12s/it, E=-8.0371(24)]
KeyboardInterrupt
>>> evaluate(net)
evaluating:  23%|â–‹  | 134/571 [01:08<03:44,  1.94it/s, E=-8.0455(32)]
```


## A simple example with the Vandermonde determinant

```python
>>> from deepqmc import Molecule, evaluate, train
>>> from deepqmc.wf import PauliNet
>>> mol = Molecule.from_name('LiH')
>>> net = PauliNet.from_hf(mol).cuda()
>>> net.use_sloglindet = 'never'
>>> net.use_vandermonde = True
>>> train(net)
>>> evaluate(net)
```
